[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/M4M03Q2JN)

Hey there! This is an additional Github repository that contains the final product files for each video in my Youtube series. The point of the videos are to learn some new programming skills, and to create the framework for projects you could find useful in the future.

I am sharing these files because some of you may be like me and benefit and learn from seeing a finished example sometimes. I truly hope that you are able to learn from these videos, and that it helps you with your goals and aspirations in the future.
